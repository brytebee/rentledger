# RentLedger

A modern rent management platform built with Next.js and Supabase that helps landlords track properties, tenants, and payments while giving tenants clear visibility into their rent status.

## About RentLedger

RentLedger simplifies rent management by replacing manual tracking (notebooks, WhatsApp chats, Excel sheets) with structured dashboards and automated payment tracking.
